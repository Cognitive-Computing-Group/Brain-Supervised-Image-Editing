# How to use this repository

## Prelimaries
### GAN Model
The CelebAHQ trained GAN model used for generation and semantic editing of facial images can be found [here](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans) via "Pre-trained networks" under [karras2018iclr-celebahq-1024x1024](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15hvzxt_XxuokSmj0uO4xxMTMWVc0cIMU).

## Pipeline

### EEG Signal Classification
The notebook "EEG_Classifier" contains full documentation on how to take the modified EEG data (100ms averages to preserve privacy) paired with the labeled stimuli and train an LDA classifier to label stimuli using brain signals.
